  |     |     required by a bound introduced by this call
  |     the trait `IntoPy<Py<PyAny>>` is not implemented for `Test`
  |
  = note: `IntoPy` is automatically implemented by the `#[pyclass]` macro
  = note: if you do not wish to have a corresponding Python type, implement it manually
  = note: if you do not own `Test` you can perform a manual conversion to one of the types in `pyo3::types::*`
  = help: the following other types implement trait `IntoPy<T>`:
            <&'a OsString as IntoPy<Py<PyAny>>>
            <&'a Path as IntoPy<Py<PyAny>>>
            <&'a PathBuf as IntoPy<Py<PyAny>>>
            <&'a PyErr as IntoPy<Py<PyAny>>>
            <&'a String as IntoPy<Py<PyAny>>>

            <&'a str as IntoPy<Py<PyAny>>>
            <&'a str as IntoPy<Py<PyString>>>
